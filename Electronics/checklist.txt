[x] Thermal simulation
    - Thermal simulation shows overtemp at maximum driver current (~3.5 A RMS).
    - Target motor phase resistance of ~22 Ohms means peak current of
      about 2*17/22 = 1.54 A in actuality which leads to perfectly acceptable
      temperatures, so this design is fine for now. If more powerful motors are
      necessary a revision with better FETs will be necessary.
